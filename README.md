# dataviscourse-3PointRevolution
This project uses data visualizations to demonstrate the prevalence of the three point shot in the modern NBA. 

The heatmap in the top left corner maps three point shots taken in the season selected by the dropdown above.
The red hue visualizes the total number of shots made over the total number of shots attempted within each bin for the season selected. 
The line charts in the center column show the top teams and players in terms of points from three point shots for the selected season. 
By hovering over a line for a team or player, the heatmap automatically populates with that team or player's respective three pointer data. 

The chart on the far right shows the top 52 players of all time by 3 pointers scored and by hovering over a data point, an overlay on the chart
will show that players career statistics. 

The buttons above the heatmap can be clicked to bring up information on Steph Curry, considered the greatest three point shooter of all time,
as well as information on the  visualizations.
